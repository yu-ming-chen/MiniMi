# MiniMi

1 in 15 People suffer from depression in Singapore.
Depression claims countless lives every year, tragedies that could have been prevented.
We aim to combat this epidemic with our application.

Minimi is an app targeted at people suffering from depression by providing them companionship in the form of a virtual pet.
Users have a pet that they take care of by performing tasks that can act as therapy for the user.
It is aimed at encouraging users to look after themselves and engage their communities.
